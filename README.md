# TASKS:
## Dataset compilation
1. Feature set identification:
    [] 1.1 Make a script for parsing features of uniref90s from UniProt by their IDs
    [] 1.2 Take a genefamilies .tsv, shuffle its entries and pick 100 random unirefs
    [] 1.3 Parse their features
    [] 1.4 Compute feature statistics: discrete/continuous variable, range, mean, standrad deviation
    [] 1.5 Explore the sample metadata, which can be found on the cluster in /cluster/tufts/bonhamlab/sequencing/

## COMMENTS:
 "Easy" feature completion can be something like "decarboxylases"
